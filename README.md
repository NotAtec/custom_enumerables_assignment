# [Custom Enumerables Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/custom-enumerables)
An assignment project part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) where a set of [Ruby Enumerables](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.0/Enumerable.html) have been recreated

## Methods recreated:
- #each
- #each_with_index
- #select
- #all?
- #any?
- #none?
- #count
- #map
- #inject

## Other assignments
A different part of the assignment was creating a test method for the #my_inject method, to confirm it working properly.

#my_map has also been editted to be able to take a [Proc](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Proc.html) instead of a Block. If both are given, the Proc has priority
